# Simple Ray Tracer
This is a simple Ray Tracer written in C++ with SDL2 and OpenGL3. It features diffuse Lambertian surfaces and simple mirrors. It uses some simple hash functions found online for random reflectance. Most of the program takes place in the fragment shader and is drawn on a quad that stretches over the whole screen.
